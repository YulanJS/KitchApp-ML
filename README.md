# KitchApp
AI that helps people cook. Machine Learning / Computer Vision project. Look at our [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y6iazmbMivtH0TH51ZRa1qjwMB7iyYltEVqyJWQKYVQ/present) to best understand our goals and progress so far.

## Proposal

People often struggle to decide what to cook, especially if they're new to cooking. New cooks don't always know how to use the ingredients in their fridge, and even more advanced cooks may be missing out on new recipes.

We present KitchApp, a computer vision mobile app that scans the ingredients in your fridge in real time. After recording the ingredients, KitchApp will recommend recipes based on what you have and your tastes.

This project lives in two repositories. This is the machine learning repository for training the ML model. See https://github.com/KimlengHor/KitchApp-iOS for the iOS frontend.

See our more detailed project proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CerrLOC7RNlCxVvakb1xYqlKRuwLCMw3yokN_BQCwmM/edit?usp=sharing).

**This project is a work in progress.**
